# KDE-MWM-CDE-Theme
A modified CDE theme to make it look more like default MWM color scheme.

I found a nice CDE aurorae theme, but didn't like the colors in it. Spending a tiny bit of time, I made it into the default green colors when you use MWM. You can see the before and after:

You can get the original from the KDE store. I kept it under the GPLv3 it originally was. Just drop this where aurorae can find it and select it in the settings menu. If colors look funky, I suggest try logging out and log back in. I learned that modifying this because the theme kept using the old colors for maximized windows while making this.
